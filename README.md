# Machine Learning and Statistics Assessment
***
## Aaron Donnelly-G00299531

### This is my submission to the Machine Learning and Statistics Module of the Data Analytics course in GMIT. This submission is broken into two main parts and contains two Jupyter Notebooks. These notebooks are the scikit learn notebook and the scipy.stats notebook.
***
## scikit-learn

### This notebook introduces the scikit-learn python package. I then go on to look at three machine learning algorithms that are contained within the package. Two of these are examples of supervised machine learning and one is an example of unsupervised machine learning. The three algorithms I explored were. 
### 1- RandomForestClassifier
### 2- RandomForestRegression
### 3- KMeans Clustering

### For each algorithm a different dataset was used. These datasets are all contained within the data folder inside the repository. I then carried out various evaluations on each of the three algorithms.
***
## scipy.stats
### This notebook introduces the scipy.stats python package contained within the scipy module. During the overview of this package I explore the uniform distribution, I then demonstrate functions like PDF, CDF and PPF. I then look at other smaller statistical functions within the library that can be used on datasets. I then demonstrate carrying out a one-way and two-way ANOVA analysis on a weight loss dataset. This dataset is also stored in the data folder.

## Notes
### Please read the instructions.txt file in the repository prior to working through the notebooks. All relevant references are located at the end of each notebook.
