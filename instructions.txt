Machine Learning and Statistics Repository Instructions.

This repository contains two Jupyter Notebooks, one for the scikit learn demonstration,
and a second for the scipy.stat demonstration. The repository also contains a data directory
which contains all the .csv used in both notebooks. Finally the repository contains a readme
which summarises the repository.  All Jupyter Notebooks have been clear of all outputs.
To run the cells please navigate to the cell button located at the top toolbar and select ‘Run All’.
This should display all cells. Two points to note when running the notebooks.


1. Please ensure that you are using the latest version of Scipy, as some of the features contained
within the notebook might not run on older versions.

2. Please ensure to keep the data file on the same tier as the original repository as changing
this will affect the file path within the notebook.
