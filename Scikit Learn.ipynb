    "#### scikit-learn is a python library that contains many tools that can be used for predictive data analysis and machine learning[1]. scikit-learn was a project started by David Cournapeau during a Google Summer of Code project[2]. sci-kit learn contains many different algorithms that are very user friendly and require very little adjusting to me the used for an individuals specific needs. When it comes in machine learning there are two types of algroithms used. These are 'Supervised' and 'Unsupervised' algorithms. "
